## The Spatiotemporal Coupling in Delay-Coordinates Dynamic Mode Decomposition
The MATLAB code in this repository accompanies the paper entitled "The Spatiotemporal Coupling in Delay-Coordinates Dynamic Mode Decomposition", and produces the results in Section VI (Illustrative Example) by executing Algorithm 1 (Proposed Algorithm).

This code was developed by Emil Bronstein and Ronen Talmon.

To run this code, simply download and run the illustrative_example.m file.
